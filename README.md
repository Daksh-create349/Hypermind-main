# HyperMind // AI Learning Companion

HyperMind is a futuristic, adaptive AI research assistant and learning companion designed to democratize high-quality education. It leverages the Google Gemini API to provide interactive tutoring, instant quiz generation, debate simulation, and real-time multimodal voice/video interaction.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Capabilities
*   **Adaptive Learning Engine:** 
    *   **Concept Tutor:** Deep explanations with analogies and step-by-step reasoning.
    *   **Debate Mode:** A contrarian persona that challenges assumptions to strengthen critical thinking.
    *   **Practice & Quiz:** Instantly generates 10-question MCQ quizzes from topics or uploaded documents with detailed AI analysis of results.
*   **Multimodal Interaction:**
    *   **Chat:** Rich text support with Markdown and Code Syntax Highlighting.
    *   **Vision:** Upload images for analysis.
    *   **Document Analysis:** Parse and summarize PDF documents (`pdfjs-dist`).
    *   **Voice Integration:** Text-to-Speech playback for AI responses.
*   **Interactive Visualizations:**
    *   **Generative UI (GenUI):** Dynamic rendering of Line, Bar, and Area charts based on data generated by the AI.
    *   **Diagramming:** Automatic generation of flowcharts and mind maps using ReactFlow.
    *   **3D Elements:** Immersive 3D scenes powered by Spline.
*   **Gemini Live (Real-time):** 
    *   Low-latency voice and video calls with the AI agent.
    *   Real-time audio visualization and camera streaming.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Frontend Library:** React 19
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **AI Model:** Google Gemini 2.5 Flash / Pro (`@google/genai` SDK)
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Custom Animations
*   **3D Rendering:** Spline (`@splinetool/react-spline`)
*   **Visualization:** Recharts (Data), ReactFlow (Diagrams)
*   **Utilities:** Lucide React (Icons), Marked (Markdown), PrismJS (Syntax Highlighting)

## 📦 Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hypermind.git
    cd hypermind
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    *Note: This project uses a no-build ESM approach via `importmap` in `index.html` for rapid prototyping, but can be adapted to a standard Vite build.*
    
    If running locally with a simple server:
    ```bash
    npx serve .
    ```

3.  **Environment Configuration**
    You must provide a Google Gemini API Key. 
    
    *Security Note: In a production environment, never expose your API key on the client side. Use a proxy server.*
    
    For local testing, ensure `process.env.API_KEY` is accessible or replace the placeholder in `components/ChatInterface.tsx` and `components/LiveSession.tsx` with your key (not recommended for public commits).

## 🎮 Usage

1.  **Landing Page:** Select a mode ("Concept Tutor" or "Practice & Quiz") to initialize the Neural Link.
2.  **Chat Interface:**
    *   Type a topic to start learning.
    *   Click the **Paperclip** to upload PDFs or Images.
    *   Switch modes using the pill selector in the top right.
3.  **Command Examples:**
    *   *"Explain Quantum Entanglement with a diagram"* (Triggers ReactFlow diagram)
    *   *"Plot the growth of AI adoption over the last decade"* (Triggers GenUI Chart)
    *   *"Quiz me on the PDF I just uploaded"* (Triggers Quiz Mode)
